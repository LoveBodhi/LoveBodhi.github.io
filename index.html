  <p>Welcome to my wonderland!<br>
  <br>
  Note that this site is under construction.<br>
  <br>
  I'm working a soundfont called "The Multi-Elemental Soundfont", this time is SC8850 Compatible one.<br>
  <br>
  You can see <a href="http://lovebodhi.github.io/TMESFProgress.html">the Progress of The Muiti-Elemental Soundfont</a>.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> Please don't give Roland SoundCanvas samples due to it doesn't realistic. The purpose of The Multi-Elemental Soundfont is Realistic instead of close to original. If you want to look for original one, use <a href="http://stgigafunware.weebly.com/">stgiga's HiDef Soundfont</a> instead!
