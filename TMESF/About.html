<h2 style="text-align: center;">About The Multi-Elemental
SoundFont<br>

















</h2>

















<div style="text-align: center;">
The Multi-Elemental SoundFont (TMESF in short) is a set of all-in-one SoundFonts. It's a split-bank.<br>

















Unlike DSoundFont Ultimate, All parts are below 1 or 2 GB, which means it's
compatible with most SoundFont players*.<br>






<br>






*Doesn't work with FluidSynth and SoundBlaster Players.<br>

















<br>

















It features the most natural, realistic, even a few of synthesized
sounds. None of 3rd party modules are used, expect M1 Piano.<br>

















<br>

















Suitable for: Electronic / Dance / EDM, Classical, Ambient, Funk / Pop, Jazz,
Rock, Metal, Fairy Tale Themed, Cinematic, 80/90's Retro, Nursery Rhyme, etc.<br>

















<br>

















TMESF is not only Roland SC-8850 map patches. Instead, It's mixed with
SC-8850 Map and other variations, like XG patches, PSR-S975 patches,&nbsp;Genos patches
(Except Super Articulation Patches), etc. Me and Strix's original
patches are also included (and it's Shared with DSoundFont Ultimate).<br>


Mainly focus Yamaha styled articulations.<br>

















<br>

















As Strix said, For CM-64 / MT-32 Support, use DSoundFont Gaming Edition.<br>

















For Roland samples usage, use HiDef. For XG&nbsp;Support, buy a
Yamaha Synthesizer or Yamaha Keyboard&nbsp;with XG / XGLite.<br>

















<br>

















<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notice: If a least of the
sample is
from 3rd party modules (Like Roland SC, Yamaha MU, etc.) exist other than M1 Piano, notify me and I'll
replace or remove the corresponding sample as possible.<br>
