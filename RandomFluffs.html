<h2 style="text-align: center;">Random Fluffs</h2>












1. None of freedom Chinese Ethnic Instruments exist at all, only
either in commercial sources (like Ample China PiPa, Kong Audio, etc.)
or restricted sources (non-commercial use only). Please don't
find them! Go away or resynthesize instead!<br>












<br>












2. Yamaha PSR-S975's sounds are amazing! Lots of tones and styles!<br>












<br>












3. It's impossible to find Jazz Scat's velocity range, unlike Yamaha's
MegaVoice Map!<br>












<br>












4. None of a real "Electric Grand" exist (Airfont 380's CP-80 is from
Keyboard sources instead of a real CP-80), especially freedom sources.<br>












<br>












5. "Realistic" means: Samples that other than 3rd party modules.<br>












<br>












6. No modulator envelopes in SoundFonts, which means real "Random"
series patches are undoable. "Random" envelope also is called "Sample
and Hold".<br>












<br>












7.&nbsp;Flower Angel musics are mostly Edirol VSTi's and SGM-V2.01.
Harp in SGM is from Roland Edirol Orchestral, but that one used in Flower Angel is from Roland SC-88.<br>












<br>











8. MIDI Grand Piano, is a combination of FM Electric Piano and two
Acoustic&nbsp;Grand Pianos (or&nbsp;Acoustic&nbsp;Grand Piano and
Electric Grand Piano).<br>











<br>











9. Parasol of Friendship (Item of Cartoon "Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Smart Dodging") is too horrible.<br>







<br>







10. Magical Girl is a danger occupation.<br>







<br>







11. Being a magician (Either Magical Girls or Magical Boys), basically
you'll need Pure Heart, Magic Wand and Spells. Transformation isn't
necessary.<br>







<br>







12. Dub is my favor, mainly I dubbed all Flower Angel's episode.<br>






<br>






13. No more freedom Real Acoustic Guitars...... I found only 3 in freesound, one is PD and the other 2 are CC-BY.<br>




<br>




14. Electronic Gutiars can be synthesized.<br>



<br>



15. VSTHost isn't freedom due to commercial unusable.<br>


<br>


16. Use the commerical permitted VST Hosts (e.g. LMMS, DarkWave Studio) for normal purposes.<br>
<br>
17. Ardour is: Free for build, pay for binary.
