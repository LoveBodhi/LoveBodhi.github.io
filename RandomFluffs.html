<h2 style="text-align: center;">Random Fluffs</h2>









1. None of freedom Chinese Ethnic Instruments exist at all, only
either in commercial sources (like Ample China PiPa, Kong Audio, etc.)
or restricted sources (non-commercial use only for example), due to
there're hard works. Please don't
find them! Go away or resynthesize (DIY) instead!<br>









<br>









2. Yamaha PSR-S975's sounds are amazing! Lots of tones and styles!<br>









<br>









3. It's impossible to find Jazz Scat's velocity range, unlike Yamaha's
MegaVoice Map! Thus, our full SC-8850 Support are almostly impossible......<br>









<br>









4. None of a real "Electric Grand" exist (Airfont 380's CP-80 is from
Keyboard sources instead of a real CP-80), especially freedom sources.<br>









<br>









5. "Realistic" means: Samples that other than 3rd party modules.<br>









<br>









6. No modulator envelopes and Legato in SoundFonts, which means real "Random" (Sample
and Hold envelope)
series and Legato patches are undoable. Thus, SC-88Pro compatible SoundFonts are imperfect.<br>









<br>









7.&nbsp;Flower Angel musics are mostly Edirol VSTi's and SGM-V2.01.
Harp in SGM is from Roland Edirol Orchestral, but that one used in
Flower Angel is from Roland SC-88.<br>









<br>









8. MIDI Grand Piano, is a combination of FM Electric Piano and two
Acoustic&nbsp;Grand Pianos (or&nbsp;Acoustic&nbsp;Grand
Piano and
Electric Grand Piano).<br>









<br>









9. Parasol of Friendship (Item of Cartoon "Pleasant Goat and Big Big
Wolf: Smart Dodging") is too horrible.<br>









<br>









10. Magical Girl is a danger occupation.<br>









<br>









11. Being a magician (Either Magical Girls or Magical Boys), basically
you'll need Pure Heart, Magic Wand and Spells. Transformation isn't
necessary.<br>









<br>









12. Dub is my favor, mainly I dubbed all Flower Angel's episode.<br>









<br>









13. No more freedom Real Acoustic Guitars...... I found only 3 in
freesound, one is PD and the other 2 are CC-BY.<br>









<br>









14. <s>Electronic Guitars can be synthesized.</s> According Strix's Random Fluff #58, If we can't find more free guitar patches, how do we do?<br>









<br>









15. VSTHost isn't freedom due to commercial unusable. Don't use.<br>









<br>









16. Use the commerical permitted VST Hosts (e.g. LMMS, DarkWave Studio)
for normal purposes.<br>









<br>









17. Ardour is: Free for build, pay for binary.<br>









<br>









18. C7 Superstar Grand (From Genos) maybe a Vartation of Piano Pad or
something?<br>









<br>









19. The most expensive synthesizer is Yamaha Genos, then PSR-S975, then
PSR-S775.<br>









<br>









20. Tip for buying synthesizer: For beginner, buy the less than 1000
RMB one (e.g. Yamaha PSR-F51, PSR-E363, Medeli M211, etc.); for
qualify, buy 1000-3000 RMB's one (e.g. Casio CTK-7300, Yamaha KB-291,
etc); for fun, buy 3000-8000 RMB's one (e.g. Yamaha PSR-S670, PSR-E463,
etc.); Higher than 8000 RMB's are for professional use (e.g. Yamaha PSR-S975,
Genos, etc.).<br>









<br>









21. Don't buy toy / cheap synthesizers due to it's&nbsp;bad. If you
wanna cheap, buy a MIDI Keyboard (25 or 37 keys) and connect to
your favorite DAW's, VST Hosts or FreePiano instead.<br>









<br>









22.&nbsp;FreePiano (Surge doesn't work properly) is suitable for
Keyboard Players and Music Beginner. It's BSD + GPL licensed.<br>









<br>









23. Genos' 70's Meditation EP is: Music Box + Suitcase (Rhodes) Piano +
FM Electric Piano + Warm Pad.<br>









<br>









24. Electric Grand can be easily made via lessly natural piano samples.<br>









<br>









25. I think there're no freedom Virtual MIDI Cables exist at all. I
only found
MIDIYoke (Not work in Win10), loopMIDI, LoopBe1, last 2 are
non-freedom, due to loopMIDI is non-commercial use and LoopBe1 is
donation for commercial use. Maybe buy a MIDI
Keyboard instead?<br>









<br>









26. Fluidsynth's limit is not&nbsp;2 GB per file, it's chaining
SoundFonts up to 1GB! Therefore, Don't use every part in FluidSynth
with TMESF!<br>









<br>









27. Linuxsampler is non-free, because it prohibit for commercial usage,
even is GPL licensed. Thus, don't use that!<br>









<br>









28. Yamaha C7 Piano samples...... can be found on Musical Artifacts.
What's the difference between C7 and C5?<br>









<br>









29. VSCO2's&nbsp;Piano Samples only can be replaced with Yamaha SU-7 Pianos due to it's Upright Piano.<br>









<br>









30. PSR-SX Series are not available in China.<br>









<br>









31. Since we have no free CP-80 Samples (Not count for sampled
synthesizers) exist, we can emulate CP-80 Dance Piano by using Acoustic
Grand Piano samples, mentioned by Random Fluff #24.<br>









<br>









32. TX16Wx prohibits redistribute + money charges (MIT + 2
limitations).<br>








<br>








33. Strix's Random Fluff #57: Super Articulations are Yamaha exclusive.
Thus, we can't do them by any samplers (Like TX16Wx,&nbsp;Kontakt
[Commercial], SoundFont, etc.), nor emulate them.<br>





<br>





34. I'm not gonna support any Game SoundFonts! I made GSF only just for fun.<br>



<br>



35. I think the 6 main Chinese Windows Fonts (SimSun, SimHei, FangSong, KaiT, Lisu, YouYuan) are in Grey Area.<br>


<br>


36. We have no CFX samples, but we can use C5/Salamander for Genos-like patches (CFX SomePianoPatch -&gt; C5 SomePianoPatch).<br>

<br>

37. Since Guitarix is Linux only, There're two other options: 1. Use
Audacity's Distortion + Equalizer feature; 2. Use LMMS' TAP Equalizer +
WaveShape Effect. (For Electric Guitars)<br>
<br>
38. Are there more free synthesizers that can load large SoundFonts? Please
find out! If no, then, disappointed.
