<h2 style="text-align: center;">Random Fluffs</h2>


<big>1. None of freedom Chinese Ethnic Instruments exist at all, only
either in commercial sources (like Ample China PiPa, Kong Audio, etc.)
or &nbsp;restricted sources (non-commercial use only). Please don't
find them! Go away or resynthsize instead!<br>

<br>

2. Yamaha PSR-S975's sounds are amazing! Lots of tones and styles!<br>

<br>

3. It's impossible to find Jazz Scat's velocity range, unlike Yamaha's MegaVoice Map!<br>

<br>

4. None of a real "Electric Grand" exist (Airfont 380's CP-80 is from
Keyboard sources instead of a real CP-80), especially freedom sources.<br>
<br>
5. "Realistic" means: Samples that other than 3rd party modules.<br>
<br>
6. No modulator envelopes in soundfonts, which means real "Random"
series patches are undoable. "Random" envelope also is called "Sample
and Hold".<br>
<br>
7.&nbsp;Flower Angel musics are mostly Edirol VSTi's and SGM-V2.01. Harp is from Roland SC-88.</big>
