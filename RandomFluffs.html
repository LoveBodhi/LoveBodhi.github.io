<h2 style="text-align: center;">Random Fluffs</h2>























1. None of freedom Chinese Ethnic Instruments exist at all, only
either in commercial sources (like Ample China PiPa, Kong Audio, etc.)
or restricted sources (non-commercial use only). Please don't
find them! Go away or resynthesize (DIY) instead!<br>























<br>























2. Yamaha PSR-S975's sounds are amazing! Lots of tones and styles!<br>























<br>























3. It's impossible to find Jazz Scat's velocity range, unlike Yamaha's
MegaVoice Map!<br>























<br>























4. None of a real "Electric Grand" exist (Airfont 380's CP-80 is from
Keyboard sources instead of a real CP-80), especially freedom sources.<br>























<br>























5. "Realistic" means: Samples that other than 3rd party modules.<br>























<br>























6. No modulator envelopes in SoundFonts, which means real "Random"
series patches are undoable. "Random" envelope also is called "Sample
and Hold".<br>























<br>























7.&nbsp;Flower Angel musics are mostly Edirol VSTi's and SGM-V2.01.
Harp in SGM is from Roland Edirol Orchestral, but that one used in Flower Angel is from Roland SC-88.<br>























<br>






















8. MIDI Grand Piano, is a combination of FM Electric Piano and two
Acoustic&nbsp;Grand Pianos (or&nbsp;Acoustic&nbsp;Grand Piano and
Electric Grand Piano).<br>






















<br>






















9. Parasol of Friendship (Item of Cartoon "Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Smart Dodging") is too horrible.<br>


















<br>


















10. Magical Girl is a danger occupation.<br>


















<br>


















11. Being a magician (Either Magical Girls or Magical Boys), basically
you'll need Pure Heart, Magic Wand and Spells. Transformation isn't
necessary.<br>


















<br>


















12. Dub is my favor, mainly I dubbed all Flower Angel's episode.<br>

















<br>

















13. No more freedom Real Acoustic Guitars...... I found only 3 in freesound, one is PD and the other 2 are CC-BY.<br>















<br>















14. Electronic Gutiars can be synthesized.<br>














<br>














15. VSTHost isn't freedom due to commercial unusable.<br>













<br>










16. Use the commerical permitted VST Hosts (e.g. LMMS, DarkWave Studio) for normal purposes.<br>











<br>











17. Ardour is: Free for build, pay for binary.<br>









<br>









18. C7 Superstar Grand (From Genos) maybe a Vartation of Piano Pad or something?<br>








<br>








19. The most expensive synthesizer is Yamaha Genos, then PSR-S975, then PSR-S775.<br>







<br>







20. Tip for buying synthesizer: For beginner, buy the less than 1000
RMB one (e.g. Yamaha PSR-F51, PSR-E363, Medeli M211, etc.); for
qualify, buy 1000-4000 RMB's one (e.g. Casio CTK-7300, Yamaha KB-291,
etc); for fun, buy 4000-8000 RMB's one (e.g. Yamaha PSR-S670, etc.);
Larger than 8000 RMB's are for professional use (e.g. Yamaha PSR-S975,
Genos, etc.).<br>







<br>



21. Don't buy toy / cheap synthesizers due to it's&nbsp;bad. If you
wanna cheap, buy a MIDI Keyboard&nbsp; (25 or 37 keys) and connect to
your favorite DAW's, VST Hosts or FreePiano instead.<br>






<br>






22.&nbsp;FreePiano (Surge doesn't work properly) is suitable for Keyboard Players and Music Beginner. It's BSD + GPL licensed.<br>





<br>





23. Genos' 70's Meditation EP is: Music Box + Suitcase (Rhodes) Piano + FM Electric Piano + Warm Pad.<br>




<br>




24. Electric Grand can be easily made via lessly natural piano samples.<br>


<br>


25. I think there're no freedom Virtual MIDI Cables? I only found
MIDIYoke (Not work in Win10), loopMIDI, LoopBe1, last 2 are non-freedom, due to commercial use are not permitted.<br>
<br>
26. Fluidsynth is not 2GB Limit, it's 1GB Limit!
