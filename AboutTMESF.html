<h2 style="text-align: center;">About The Multi-Elemental
Soundfont<br>

</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;">
The Multi-Elemental Soundfont (TMESF in short) is a set of all-in-one
soundfonts. It's a split-bank.<br>

Unlike DSoundFont Ultimate, All parts are below 2GB, which means it's
compatible with most soundfont players.<br>

<br>

It features the most natural, realistic, even a few of synthsized
sounds. None of 3rd party modules are used, expect M1 Piano.<br>

<br>

Suitable for: Electronic / Dance / EDM, Classical, Funk / Pop, Jazz,
Rock, Metal, Fairy Tale Themed, Cinematic, 80/90's Retro, etc.<br>

<br>

TMESF is not only Roland SC-8850 map patches. Instead, It's mixed with
SC-8850 Map and other variations, like XG patches, PSR-S975 patches
(Except Super Atriculation Patches), etc. Me and Strix's original
patches are also included (and it's Shared with DSoundFont Ultimate).<br>

<br>

As Strix said, For CM-64 / MT-32 Support, use DSoundFont Gaming Edition.<br>

For Roland samples usage, use HiDef. For XG&nbsp;Support, buy a
Yamaha Synthsizer or Yamaha Keyboard&nbsp;with XG / XGLite.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notice: If a least of the
sample is
from 3rd party modules (Like Roland SC, Yamaha MU, etc.) exist, I'll
replace or remove the corresponding sample as possible.<br>
