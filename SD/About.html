<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Starlight Dream<br>




</h2>




<div style="text-align: center;">Starlight Dream is a set
of all-in-one SoundFonts. It's a split-bank.<br>




Unlike DSoundFont Ultimate or Enchant!, All parts are below 1 or 2 GB,
which means
it's
compatible with most SoundFont players*, even freely-licensed.<br>




<br>




*Doesn't work with FluidSynth 1.x and SoundBlaster Players.<br>




<br>




It features the most natural, realistic, even a few of synthesized
sounds, unlike "Enchant!". None of 3rd party modules are used.<br>




<br>




Suitable for: Electronic / Dance / EDM, Classical, Ambient, Funk / Pop,
Jazz,
Rock, Metal, Fairy Tale Themed, Cinematic, 80/90's Retro, Nursery
Rhyme, etc.<br>




<br>




Starlight Dream&nbsp;is not only Roland SC-8850 map patches.
Instead, It's mixed with
SC-8850 Map and other variations, like XG patches, PSR-S975
patches, PSR-SX900 Patches,&nbsp;Genos patches
(Except Super Articulation Patches), etc. Me and Strix's original
patches are also included (and it's Shared with DSoundFont Ultimate and
Enchant!).<br>




Mainly focus Yamaha styled articulations.<br>




<br>




As Strix said, For CM-64 / MT-32 Support, use DSoundFont Gaming Edition.<br>




For Roland samples usage, use HiDef. For XG&nbsp;Support, buy a
Yamaha Synthesizer or Yamaha Keyboard&nbsp;with XG / XGLite.<br>




<br>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notice: If a least of the
sample is
from 3rd party modules (Like Roland SC, Yamaha MU, etc.), notify me and
I'll
instantly down this SoundFont and replace, re-new or remove the
corresponding sample as possible.<br>

<h2>Backstory</h2>


I created this SoundFont in 2019-8. Firstly I'm fill for GM Bank
casually, such as Lithalean samples, Grand GIG, etc. Then, I was
replaced Yamaha Grand Piano with Grand GIG, and thinking about how to
fill the restricted / sampleless instruments.&nbsp;I have none of any
acoustic instruments. At this time, I was thought an idea to do these
on Synthesizers rather than&nbsp;Sound Module samples.&nbsp;This is
called "Re-synthesize". I also added Yamaha Keyboards Patches with my
inspiration. Later, SC-8850 Banks are filled, now I'm gonna do more
patches like DX7, Access Virus, etc.<br>


For sample cleanup, First, I download a Roland Manual, Then I've
checked SGM's Sound Sample Source, mostly from Roland XV Series and V-Synth Series! I'm
accidently heard&nbsp;a song that uses "Eastwest" VSTi, then I
discovered Lithalean Instruments are based on those samples, along with
other commercial sources. Mostly, Electric Grand are sampled, and it's
rare, thus libre samples of this aren't exist, it's in a dead end.
Nextly, since I think there're processed Acoustic Grand, I'm thought to
use the same way, via less samples. I think there're huge of
unrealistic samples or samples that infringe copyrights (commercial
samples).
